# Language Predictor.

We have made a model which allow us to know the language of a given text. To do this we have used
the paralel corpus from the European Parlament:  http://www.statmt.org/europarl/. The machine learning model 
have been constructed entierly in this project, we just used libraries for cleaning tasks.

## Data_and_model.py 

Here we see how to obtain the data needed to train (form the corpus mentioned), and we see
the code of the model, but it's better expained in Model.ipynb.

## Model.ipynb

In this notebook we can see the code of the model, and how to use it.
